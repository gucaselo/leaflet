# Mapping Web with Leaflet

### Background
In an effort to show the relationship between tectonic plates and seismic activity the following datasets were selected to be visualize on a map: 

* [GeoJSON](http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php) data from the United States Geological Survey (USGS).
* [Tectonic Plates](https://github.com/fraxen/tectonicplates) dataset. 

###  Design


Using `HTML`, `Javascript`, `CSS` and `Leaflet` to generate an interactive map using [MapBox API](https://docs.mapbox.com/api/overview/). This design will provide the following user options:

Map Views:
* Street Map
* Dark Map

Optional Markers:
* Earthqueakes (Last 30 days) in the US Region and Mexico.
* Tectonic Plates
